            <h1>IVF and Scientific Adoption Curves</h1>
    
            <div class="section content">
                <p>I thought about how society processes scientific innovations due to fortuitous timing: I was reading "<a href="https://vinaysridhar.com/review.html?id=2">The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down</a>" while my wife and I were going through IVF. We observed the variety in reactions from people in our lives when they learned about our choice.</p>
    
                <p>I posit: Scientific inventions that fundamentally alter an aspect of life we hold as "natural", they face a distinct pattern of social acceptance. The key is whether the technology challenges what society considers "natural" processes.</p>
    
                <p>Consider these two categories:</p>
    
                <p>Innovations that faced significant resistance (from 10 minutes of Google searching):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>IVF (altering natural conception)</li>
                    <li>Vaccination (challenging natural immunity)</li>
                    <li>Organ donation (violating bodily integrity)</li>
                    <li>Blood transfusion (mixing "life forces")</li>
                    <li>C-sections and epidurals (bypassing natural birth and the <em>haseen dard</em> it comes with)</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>Innovations that did not face as much resistance:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Electric lights (no "natural" lighting process being altered)</li>
                    <li>Stethoscopes (just listening, not intervening)</li>
                    <li>Washing machines (mechanizing an artificial, laborious process)</li>
                    <li>MRI scans (observing, not changing nature)</li>
                    <li>Insulin injections (this one is interesting, I would have expected it to be in the first category)</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>The pattern is generally clear: Technologies that observe or assist natural processes face little resistance. Those that override or replace natural processes face generational resistance.</p>
    
                <p>I think the acceptance sequence typically follows this pattern:</p>
    
                <h2>1. The First Wave</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scientists and medical professionals closest to the innovation</li>
                    <li>Their acceptance is immediate; they understand the technology and see no stigma</li>
                    <li>Early adopters whose identity revolves around being first to try new things. <em>I am usually in this camp, can't wait to sign up for my AI hologram so my daughter can talk to "me" after I die</em></li>
                </ul>
    
                <h2>2. The Second Wave</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>People who come of age when the technology is already established</li>
                    <li>For them, it's not a "new technology" but simply part of the world</li>
                    <li>They lack the psychological baggage of the previous generation</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h2>3. The Trailing Wave (<em>vivid in our IVF experience</em>)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Family members of early adopters</li>
                    <li>Their acceptance is often reluctant but inevitable</li>
                    <li>They're pulled along by their connection to users of the technology</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>I think the key threshold is social proximity. A technology starts becoming "normal" within a social group when people know 5-10 others in their immediate circle who have openly used it. Until then, it remains in a grey zone—available but not quite acceptable.</p>
    
                <p>This framework helps predict which future technologies might face resistance. Consider genetic modification or artificial wombs—all alter "natural" processes and will likely face similar acceptance curves.</p>
    
                <p>An interesting question is whether this cycle can be shortened as society becomes more technologically adapted. Science needs to get better at <a href = "https://www.readthesequences.com/Expecting-Short-Inferential-Distances">communicating innovations.</a></p>
