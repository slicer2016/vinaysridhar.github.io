    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <section class="intro">
        <p>I grew up in Bangalore and now live in Brooklyn with my wife, dog and daughter. I am currently a Product Manager at Reddit. Over the years, I have worked in media, consulting and government in India and the US. I studied engineering at IIT Madras and and business at Harvard University. See my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vinay-sridhar/">Linkedin</a> for more on my professional life. </p>
        <p>In my free time, I consume all kinds of content, write book reviews, take photographs, compete in trivia tournaments, collect art and cook South Indian food. I also advise a non-profit called <a href="https://righttolive.org/">Right To Live</a> in Bangalore, India. </p>
    </section>
    
    <h2>Thoughts</h2>
    <section class="content">
        <p>Go <a href="bookindex.html">here</a> to read my book reviews and <a href="photography.html">here</a> for a collection of my photographs. </p>
        
        <p>I also write about ideas I've explored. A few have been published in the Indian press (<a href="articles_1.html">on Indian politics</a>, <a href="articles_2.html"> on Indian business leaders</a>), but the majority are on my Notes app. More on this coming. </p>

    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <section class="content">
        <p>I tend to have brief obsessions about a range of things, and develop quick, sometimes incorrect, and loosely-held opinions. This is an incomplete list of my <a href ="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d8swyEGjMk"> Roman Empires</a>:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>  Happiness, satisfaction and ambition</li>
            <li>  The business of consumer and media technology</li>
            <li>  Gen Z and Gen Alpha lingo</li>
            <li>  The politics of science and scientific progress</li>
            <li>  Religion, morality and its interaction with society</li>
            <li>  Nature and our relationship with the wild</li>
            <li>  Contemporary art, especially from Indian artists</li>
            <li>  How wealthy Indians live (<a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gyl771NSojQ&t=1s">I'm serious</a>)</li>
            
        </ul>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <section class="content">
        <p>I've started building software in my spare time as a new hobby. Some reflections on what I learned building these tools with LLMs <a href = "articles_3.html"> here</a>. A few recent projects (will host on Github soon):</p>
        <ul>
            <li>  Shorten podcast episodes by summarizing long-winded host questions and recreating it in a new voice while keeping the guest content unchanged (uses ChatGPT's Whisper, Eleven Labs and SpeechBrain)</li>
            <li>  Generate ad creatives including the headline and image for different audiences with one click (uses ChatGPT 4o-mini, Stability AI)</li>
            <li>  [In Progress] An app that lets children create their own bedtime stories in different styles e.g., tell me a story about a dog called Layla in the style of Beatrix Potter (uses ChatGPT, DALL-E)</li>
            
        </ul>
