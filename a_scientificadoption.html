            <h1>IVF and Scientific Adoption Curves</h1>
    
            <div class="section content">
                <p>I thought about how society processes scientific innovations due to fortuitous timing: I was reading "<a href="https://vinaysridhar.com/review.html?id=2" target="_blank">The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down</a>" while my wife and I were going through IVF. We observed the variety in reactions from people in our lives when they learned about our choice.</p>
    
                <p>I posit: Scientific inventions that fundamentally alter an aspect of life we hold as "natural", they face a distinct pattern of social acceptance. The key is whether the technology challenges what society considers "natural" processes.</p>
    
                <p>Consider these two categories:</p>
    
                <p>A range of innovations faced significant resistance (from 10 minutes of Google searching): IVF (alters natural conception), vaccination (challenges natural immunity), organ donation (violates bodily purity), blood transfusions (mixes life forces), C-sections and epidurals (bypasses natural birth and the <em>haseen dard</em> it comes with)</p>
                
    
                <p>In contrast, many did not: stethoscopes (just listening, not intervening), washing machines (mechanizing an artificial, laborious process), electric lights (no "natural" lighting process being altered), MRI scans (observing, not changing nature) etc. </p>
    
                <p>The pattern feels clear: Technologies that observe or assist "natural" processes face little resistance. Those that alter "natural" processes face generational resistance. Critically, conceptions of "natural" also vary by culture and is a social construct.</p>
    
                <p>I think the acceptance sequence typically follows this pattern:</p>
    
                <h2>Wave 1</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Scientists and medical professionals closest to the innovation</li>
                    <li>Their acceptance is immediate; they understand the technology and see no stigma</li>
                    <li>Early adopters whose identity revolves around being first to try new things. <em>I am usually in this camp, can't wait to sign up for my AI hologram so my daughter can talk to "me" after I die</em></li>
                </ul>
    
                <h2>Wave 2</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>People who come of age when the technology is already established</li>
                    <li>For them, it's not a "new technology" but simply part of the world</li>
                    <li>They lack the psychological baggage of the previous generation</li>
                </ul>
    
                <h2>Wave 3 (<em>vivid in our IVF experience</em>)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Family members of early adopters</li>
                    <li>Their acceptance is often reluctant but inevitable</li>
                    <li>They're pulled along by their connection to users of the technology</li>
                </ul>
    
                <p>I think the key threshold is social proximity. A technology starts becoming "normal" within a social group when people know 5-10 others in their immediate circle who have openly used it. Until then, it remains in a grey zone—available but not quite acceptable.</p>
    
                <p>This framework helps predict which future technologies might face resistance. Consider genetic modification or artificial wombs—all alter "natural" processes and will likely face similar acceptance curves.</p>
    
                <p>An interesting question is whether this cycle can be shortened as society becomes more technologically adapted. Science needs to get better at <a href = "https://www.readthesequences.com/Expecting-Short-Inferential-Distances" target="_blank">communicating innovations.</a></p>
