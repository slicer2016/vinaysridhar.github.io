      "title": "On Aphantasia",
      "note": "Fascinating read. One point that struck was on how aphantasics may be more likely to take the position \u201cthe ends justify the means\u201d because they can\u2019t visualize the problems of the means - reminded me of the book The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt. So much of our political positions are a function of our personalities. If there are neurological predictors, may help recontextualize people\u2019s political views",

      "note": "Fab read. Reminded me of Pankaj Mishra\u2019s \u201cFrom the Ruins of Empire\u201d - sometimes I think how recent these dramatic historical changes are and how we\u2019re still living in the immediate aftermath of these events.",
