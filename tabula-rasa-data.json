      "note": "Lovely story of a \u201cfamily\u201d that was created outside of traditional notions of what a family is. Reading things like this makes me more conscious that all these concepts are cultural and arbitrary. And that we have the ability to reshape the world around us.",

      "title": "Tyler Cowen and Alison Gopnik",
      "note": "Really enjoyed this episode. I do think she was evasive on some questions of heritability but I found a lot of her views intriguing - the idea that nature vs nurture is too simplistic (that high quality nurture could actually drive variability vs moving the mean), the hypothetical of how it would be to teach baseball the way we teach science, Eric Turkheimer\u2019s research etc. Worth a listen.",

      "title": "Manu Joseph on India\u2019s Rich Protesting",
      "note": "Interesting take. Reminds me of Hirschman\u2019s Exit Voice and Loyalty. Manu\u2019s thesis is that Exit has become harder for rich Indians, resulting in Voice. If this is right, America shutting down immigration might have a powerful effect on the quality of public services in India. Would be sweet.",

      "title": "On Pharma, with Eli Lilly\u2019s CEO",
      "note": "Excellent episode. There\u2019s something about path dependency and system design that determines so much of why the world looks the way it does. Drug pricing, gross to net ratios and how \u201cprices in the US are meaningless\u201d, biotech vs pharmaceuticals. Recommend",

      "title": "On Aphantasia",
      "note": "Fascinating read. One point that struck was on how aphantasics may be more likely to take the position \u201cthe ends justify the means\u201d because they can\u2019t visualize the problems of the means - reminded me of the book The Righteous Mind by Jonathan Haidt. So much of our political positions are a function of our personalities. If there are neurological predictors, may help recontextualize people\u2019s political views",

      "note": "Fab read. Reminded me of Pankaj Mishra\u2019s \u201cFrom the Ruins of Empire\u201d - sometimes I think how recent these dramatic historical changes are and how we\u2019re still living in the immediate aftermath of these events.",
