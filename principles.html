            <ol>
                <li>Choose being kind over being right</li>
                <li>Treat people the same regardless of their status relative to yours. Humans are social animals, people notice</li>
                <li>Never be mean, especially not to someone who can hurt you by doing nothing</li>
                <li>Friendships are as important as family. Invest in your friends and prioritize making new ones. The larger the universe's friendship stock, the better off we will all be</li>
                <li>You settle for the love you think you deserve. Value yourself more and you will be more thoughtful in whom you prioritize</li>
                <li>Surround yourself with people whose eyes light up when they see you coming (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NZq6TyGR80" target="_blank">Andre De Shields</a>)</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>By extension, praise easily and often. (this also extends to social media - don't lurk, if you like something, say something)</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>Everything and everybody has a light, and it's your job to find it (<a href="https://www.haggadot.com/clip/story-birthday-world" target="_blank">Tikkun Olam</a>)</li>
                <li>** Everyone has black holes in their lives; scarcely talked about events that shape the rest of their being. Remember that as you negatively judge someone (<a href="https://fs.blog/krista-tippett-listening-questions/" target="_blank">Krista Tippett</a>)</li>
                <li>Treat animals the same way you treat humans. These distinctions are arbitrary and constructed (<a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/04/17/836139237/learning-lessons-from-inspiration-despite-complexity-in-why-fish-dont-exist" target="_blank">Lulu Miller</a>)</li>
                <li>Everyone — atheists included — has a God. For many people, it is money, fame and power. Know what yours is (<a href="https://fs.blog/david-foster-wallace-this-is-water/" target="_blank">David Foster Wallace</a>)
                    <ol>
                        <li>By extension, find your temple. Going there will give you peace. Museums are one of my temples</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Conversations are a form of art. <a href = "https://vinaysridhar.com/review.html?id=14">Treat conversation like improv</a> - <i>"your job as an improviser is not to come up with clever lines but to make your partner’s shitty line sound good."</i></li>
                <li>People who enjoy "exploring" ideas versus "defining" ideas make for more interesting conversation</li>
                <li>The best kind of charisma is when you make the other person feel that you are seeing the best version of themselves. We sometimes call this flirting</li>
                <li>A majority of people's decisions are driven by signaling. This is not inherently bad. If you see the world this way, a lot more things start to make sense (<a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/robin-hanson/" target="_blank">Robin Hanson</a>)
                    <ol>
                        <li>I'm pretty sure my desire to post this list online (it's been on my Notes app for a while) is to signal that I'm a reflective person. Now that I have, I hope it's working</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Approach every negotiation with the belief that there exists a win-win outcome. If you haven't found it, you haven't looked hard enough</li>
                <li>Reading fiction will help you understand people better (<a href="http://www.geonius.com/eliot/#:~:text=%5BT%5Dhe%20only%20effect%20Ibeing%20struggling%20erring%20human%20creatures." target="_blank">George Eliot</a>, among others)</li>

                <li>Your identity comes in the way of seeing clearly. Prune your "identity surface area". Avoid using labels to describe yourself, use verbs instead. Group identities are especially pernicious (<a href="https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/324/32433390008.pdf" target="_blank">George Kateb</a>)

                        <li>If you are offended often, it likely means you have a large identity surface area.</li>

                <li>Never let your ego get too close to your position in a conversation</li>

There are interesting frictions and incongruities in these places, and often, if you stand at the point of tangency, you can see both sides better than if you were in the middle of either one.

                <li>** You are not your career</li>
                <li>You control whether you think your work has meaning. The meaning-making part has less to do with your work and more to do with your sense of self</li>

                <li>Your career will likely be 40+ years long. Remember that as you make decisions, you will likely have multiple careers</li>
                <li>Great managers who believe in you are transformative. They will change the arc of your career and sense of self</li>
                <li>Every job has some bullshit. You can only decide what kind of bullshit you're willing to take</li>
                <li>Think of work as a video game you're choosing to play. It makes the hard days easier</li>
                <li>There is 'alpha' in willing to roll up your sleeves and do the work nobody wants to do</li>
                <li>You cannot be successful without engaging with the detail. The best professionals do not hesitate to go deep if they need to</li>
                <li>First principles thinking can get you surprisingly far. Expertise mainly helps in getting to the right answer faster</li>
                <li>Networking is a terrible idea. Instead, replace it with (4) from "On Living" (<a href="https://vinaysridhar.com/review.html?id=22">Joseph Kennedy</a>, among others)</li>
                    <ul>    
                        <li><i>"I think JPK's exceptional rise is much more defined by his ability to build and sustain relationships with a wide variety of people than anything else he does well (dedication and commitment, analytical ability etc.). At b-schools we spend a lot of time talking about "networking", which I think is terrible phrasing, instantly framing the complex act of forming a new relationship as a mercenary, transactional interaction. I think the right way to do it is to have a prevailing belief that friendships are important and helpful and that what goes around comes around, while approaching each new person as a potential relationship where you must attempt to add value in their life. I think Nasaw phrases it wonderfully: "Friendship was, for him, a priceless commodity. He had a gift for friendship, though he knew it did not always come easily, that one had to work at it, stay in touch, celebrate the good times, offer condolences in the bad. I spent most of my teenage years in a community that narrowly believed that skill only comprised qualitative analytical ability, a framing that results in all other qualities being seen as stop-gap, less-worthy ways of achieving success. People like JPK help disprove this idea: a lot of people can do math, it isn't sufficient."</i></li>
