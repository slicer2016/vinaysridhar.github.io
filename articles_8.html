    <h1>My Dog's Utility Function</h1>

    <p><a href="https://conversationswithtyler.com/">Conversations with Tyler</a> is probably my all-time favorite podcast. Tyler usually ends episodes with a "What is your production function?". It's a great question and something I've often thought about.</p>

    <p>We adopted our dog L four years ago - a negative NPV decision but one of the best decision we've ever made. I have realized she has remarkably consistent preferences, and is clearly always optimizing for something specific. This is an attempt at capturing her <em>utility</em> function, given she doesn't produce anything.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Playing ball outdoors > playing ball indoors > playing with other dogs > not playing</li>

        <li>Her <a href="https://www.chewy.com/brands/chuckit-6621">Chuck-It ball</a> > any Chuck-It ball > Any other ball > sticks >>>> balls with poop
            <ul>
                <li>She clearly has some intuition of what is hers vs not. Wonder what her conception of property rights is (probably like Stalin: "all balls are already either mine, or should be mine")</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Meat treats > Rotis > Kibble with cheese + peanut butter on top > kibble with cheese > kibble with cheese underneath > kibble with peanut butter > kibble</li>

        <li>Ball in mouth > Food in mouth with ball nearby > Food in mouth with no ball in sight</li>

        <li><i>[Daytime]</i> Sleeping on sofa > sleeping on our bed > sleeping on her dog-bed > sleeping on a carpet >>> sleeping on the wooden floor</li>

        <li><i>[After sundown]</i> Sleeping in crate > sleeping on sofa > sleeping on her dog-bed >>> not sleeping at all
            <ul>
                <li>She clearly has a circadian rhythm which is largely similar to humans'.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Resting on a <em>familiar</em> well-endowed human thigh > Resting on an <em>unfamiliar</em> well-endowed human thigh > resting on a sofa with no thigh nearby > resting on a bony thigh, regardless of familiarity</li>

        <li>Pooping on grass > pooping by the curb > pooping on a <a href="https://portal.311.nyc.gov/article/?kanumber=KA-01670">NYC grate</a> > pooping in the middle of a sidewalk >>>> pooping indoors (usually our fault)</li>

        <li>[When needs to pee <em>and</em> poo] Poop first and then pee > pee first and then poop</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Will keep adding to this list.</p>
