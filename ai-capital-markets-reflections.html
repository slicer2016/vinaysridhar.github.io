    <h1>Observations on AI and the Capital Markets in 2025</h1>
 
    <p>I lead a Product team at Reddit, where LLMs are at the heart of nearly all our work. Like everyone with a mobile phone today, I use AI tools daily and remain excited about its potential.</p>

    <p>But I also follow the financial markets - where there's increasing chatter about a poetntial AI bubble. Some recent examples:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon-warns-stock-market-drawdown-is-coming.html" target="_blank">warned at Italian Tech Week</a> that while AI presents opportunities, some investors are overlooking <i>"things you should be skeptical about"</i></li>
        <li>Derek Thompson's recent interview with Paul Kedrosky <a href="https://www.derekthompson.org/p/this-is-how-the-ai-bubble-will-pop" target="_blank">"This is how the AI bubble will pop"</a> is as skeptical as it gets — and the podcast's gotten a lot of traction on Investing Twitter</li>
        <li>Josh Wolfe at Lux Capital - who is long AI, of course - <a href="https://x.com/wolfejosh/status/1975935788668826089" target="_blank">tweeted</a> that he bought QQQ puts through Q1 2026 saying it is <i>"...reminiscent of early 00s bubble telecom roundtrip deals."</i></li>
    </ul>

    <p>What finally caught my attention was this stat from an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/06/opinion/ai-growth-economy-jobs-tariffs.html" target="_blank">NYT article by Natasha Sarin</a> (via Marginal Revolution): <i>"To provide some sense of scale, that means the equivalent of about $1,800 per person in America will be invested this year on AI"</i>. That is a <strong>bucketload</strong> of spending.</p>

    <p>So I decided to form my own POV. I plan to share the facts as I see them and what I think will likely happen - as of early Oct 2025.</p>

    <h2>Stylized Facts on AI Today</h2>

    <h3 id="seeing1">1. CapEx Ratios are Highly Inflated</h3>
    
    <p>Hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and Meta) historically ran capex at 11-16% of revenue. Today they're at 22%, with revenue YoY growth in the 15-25% range (ex Nvidia) - capex spending is dramatically outpacing revenue growth. The four major hyperscalers are spending approximately $320 billion combined on AI infrastructure in 2025 - with public statements on how <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/zuckerberg-says-meta-will-invest-hundreds-billions-superintelligence-2025-07-14/">this will likely continue in the coming years.</a></p>

    <div class="image-container">
            <img src="https://i.ibb.co/PZpQsh0X/1-Hyperscaler-Scaling.webp" alt="Hyperscaler AI Capex">
            <div class="image-caption">From <a href="https://www.exponentialview.co/p/is-ai-a-bubble?r=3dkp&utm_medium=ios&triedRedirect=true">Exponential View</a></div>
        </div>

    <p>Using the current 22% capex-to-revenue ratio, every dollar of investment should generate roughly $4.5 in annual revenue to maintain historical return profiles. At the pre-AI norm of 15% capex-to-revenue, it's closer to $6.5. This means the market expects these investments to generate <strong>$1.4-2.1 trillion</strong> in incremental annual revenue. And as these playerscontinue to invest in improved GPUs and AI infrastructure, this number grows. For context: During the telecom boom of the late 1990s, the top carriers increased capex from 15-18% of revenue to 25-30%.</p>

    <p>This is even showing up in broader US GDP numbers! ~40% of the US real GDP growth last quarter was driven by tech capex.</p>

            <div class="image-caption">AI Capex Contribution to US GDP</div>
        </div>

    <h3 id="seeing2">2. AI's P&L Impact Takes Time to Materialize</h3>

    <p><a href="https://fortune.com/2025/08/18/mit-report-95-percent-generative-ai-pilots-at-companies-failing-cfo/" target="_blank">MIT's NANDA initiative</a> found that about 5% of AI pilot programs work in reality — and this report and a host of "takes" invaded our Linkedin Feeds for a few weeks. The core issue isn't model quality but the integration needed into existing workflows. A friend who runs an SMB roll-up and is investing in AI-led operational improvements concurs - it isn't showing up in P&Ls yet. Traditional tech stacks are built assuming deterministic technology - the stack will either need to change to handle probabilistic black-box LLMs or the platforms need to hide this complexity from customers. Either way - these things will take time.</p>

    <p>While this means opportunity remains, it will take time for the scale of the incremental revenue needed ($1.4T+ annualized) to actually translate.</p>

    <p>I am paying more attention to enterprise because I also believe that AI will not result in net-new consumer platforms in the near-term (beyond ChatGPT, of course). I expect most AI-driven revenue to come from existing line items in enterprise P&Ls.</p>

    <h3 id="seeing3">3. Valuations Haven't Reached Previous Peak Levels</h3>

    <p>Current valuations, while elevated, remain "much lower" than prior tech bubbles. The Nasdaq's forward P/E ratio is ~28X today. At the 2000 peak, it exceeded 70X. Even in 2007 before the financial crisis, tech valuations were higher relative to earnings than they are now.</p>

    <p>Looking more closely, the MAG7 — who are spending the majority of this capex — has a blended P/E of ~32X — expensive, as Coatue's Laffont brothers <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/7h8ctH9qH746Dj20h0QDIx?si=93ac6695e4f84c46" target="_blank">said in June</a>, but not extreme relative to past tech bubbles.</p>

    <h3 id="seeing4">4. IPO Activity Remains Subdued</h3>

    <p>Tech IPO volume hasn't approached previous boom levels. In 1999, there were ~500 IPOs in the US. In 2021 — the peak of the recent SPAC/IPO boom — there were ~400. In 2023, just ~100. Additionally, the class of 2021 bubbles are trading 50% below their listing price (from Coatue).</p>

    <p>That said, IPOs are not a great indicator in 2025 when private markets are massive -- and active. Stripe is 14 years old, valued at $70 billion, still private. OpenAI is 9 years old and valued at $500 billion, with no public IPO timeline. Anthropic, founded in 2021, valued at $60 billion, private. Companies don't need public markets to raise significant capital — so the lack of IPOs is likely not a good indicator that markets are not overvaluing future cash flows.</p>

            <div class="image-caption">Public markets for newly listed companies are not frothy</div>
        </div>

    <h3 id="seeing5">5. Interest Rates Are Structurally Higher</h3>

    <p>The federal funds rate is 4.75-5.00% versus near zero for most of the 2010s. During the late 1990s, rates averaged 5-6%, but has begun declining into the 2000 crash.</p>

    <p>Higher rates should, in theory, compress valuations. Yet tech valuations have remained elevated. This suggests either: (a) investors believe AI growth rates are high enough to overcome the discount rate, or (b) there's so much capital with nowhere else to go that it's ignoring traditional valuation discipline.</p>

    <p><i>Of note: points (3), (4) and (5) are what Goldman's Americas Technology equity research is forming their view that we are not in a bubble in the next 6-12 months</i>.</p>

    <h3 id="seeing6">6. Private Credit Is All Over This Infrastructure Spend</h3>

    <p>Many of Matt Levine's recent posts involve Private Credit — which has been a fascinating trend to me. While this is probably safer for the ecosystem on-net (versus traditional bank lending with short-term liabilities that fund long-term assets). <a href="https://www.bny.com/corporate/global/en/insights/rise-of-private-credit.html" target="_blank">Private credit AUM has grown 10X</a> to $1.7 trillion in 2025 since the financial crisis.</p>

    <p>Some of these unusual related party transactions (OpenAI paying for AMD's chips partially with AMD's own stock) AI firms are shifting huge amounts of AI spending off their books into SPVs that disguise the cost of the AI build-out. First Balance's recent bankruptcy is the first instance of a breakdown that involves private creditors being impacted. Meanwhile, Blackstone raised $70 billion for data center infrastructure in 2024. Oracle, Microsoft, and CoreWeave have structured billion-dollar data center deals financed through private credit rather than balance sheet capex.</p>

    <p>I find this notable given that the MAG7 combined had $324 billion in free cash flow in 2024. They <em>can</em> afford to fund a majority of this AI capex without leverage. This matters because off-balance-sheet investment creates opacity. When it's in SPVs or structured as customer financing deals, the accountability is murkier. The accounting tricks depress reported infrastructure spending, inflating profits.</p>

    <h3 id="seeing7">7. GPU Depreciation Schedules Don't Match Reality</h3>

    <p>Nvidia now unveils a new AI chip every year instead of every two years. Jensen Huang said in March that <i>"when Blackwell starts shipping in volume you couldn't give Hoppers away"</i>.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, companies keep extending depreciation schedules. Microsoft: 4 to 6 years (2022). Alphabet: 4 to 6 years (2023). Amazon and Oracle: 5 to 6 years (2024). Meta: 5 to 5.5 years (January 2025). Amazon partially reversed course in January 2025, moving some assets back to 5 years, noting this would cut operating profit by $700m.</p>

    <p><a href="https://www.economist.com/business/2025/09/18/the-4trn-accounting-puzzle-at-the-heart-of-the-ai-cloud" target="_blank">The Economist</a> analyzed the impact: if servers depreciate over 3 years instead of current schedules, the AI big five's combined annual pre-tax profit falls by $26bn (8% of last year's total). Over 2 years: $1.6trn market cap hit. Take Huang literally at 1 year: $4trn, one-third of their collective worth.</p>

    <p>As short-seller Jim Chanos noted: if Meta's AI chips have a true economic lifespan of 2-3 years, "most of its 'profits' are materially overstated." Barclays estimated higher depreciation costs would shave 5-10% from earnings per share.</p>

    <h2>What I think May Happen</h2>

    <h3 id="thinking1">1. P&L Impact is First Seen in Marketing Expenses and Engineering Opex</h3>
    <p>There are two AI-driven areas that have found PMF in enterprise: Digital Ads and Coding. I think these are the two areas we should first see incremental revenue.</p>
    
    <p><em>On digital ads</em>: The MAG7 that are heavy on advertising (Meta, Google, Amazon) will see benefits first. My bet is that digital ads will be the first big winner in terms of enterprise impact from AI investments - with higher ROAS from better ad targeting models. Largely because these improvements will require little-to-no change for customers - benefits will accrue to the broader industry faster than other forms -- which may require integrations into existing workflows.</p>

    <p><em>On headcount</em>: The other area of enterprise PMF  We're already seeing software engineering hiring slow - companies will accomplish more, faster with fewer FTEs. This also means that MAG7 and the broader Tech sector will benefit dramatically. We should then start seeing this show up in labor markets, starting  (more layoffs?).</p>

    <h3 id="thinking2">2. A Short-Term Correction but Long-Term Trend Continues</h3>

    <p>The $1.4-2.1T in incremental annual revenue will materialize, but just not in 3-5 years. Which means we will likely see a period of flat-to-modest growth while P&L impact catches up to infrastructure capacity. Stock multiples will compress, and maybe even crash. Some capex gets cut in 2026-2027, then resumes when we start seeing traction.</p>

    <p>Cloud computing took a decade to justify its infrastructure buildout -- as did mobile to gain adoption. AI will likely follow the same path. As Tyler Cowen <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2025/02/why-i-think-ai-take-off-is-relatively-slow.html">notes</a>, the O-Ring model will imply that the bottleneck will move to other parts of a sector. Even electricity arguably took half a decade to fully diffuse.</p>

    <p>My bet is that the correction will start with something banal - reports of MAG7 not meeting market expectations of incremental cloud revenue from AI investments, a leaked insider view of how retention is low, the hyperscalers renegotiating their private credit obligations.</p>

    <h3 id="thinking3">3. Spend Reallocations are Not Incremental</h3>

    <p>For example, say an SMB spends $10M on Salesforce + data analysts + customer service reps. They shift to spending $10M on AI agents + infrastructure instead — with the hyperscalers booking revenue growth. GDP sees limited incremental growth, but employment drops in affected sectors.</p>

    <p>This is probably already happening but I don't have data e.g., spend on OpenAI takes from spend on another provider that is not AI but solved the same JTBD.</p>

    <p>At the same time, I wonder if not all of the MAG7 companies win. Maybe 2-3 capture 80% of AI value - does AWS lose versus Google Cloud or Azure given their lack of access to a cutting-edge foundational model and relative lower investment levels in AI capex?</p>

    <p>This has happened in every tech cycle. The infrastructure phase looks like everyone wins, but the next phase reveals who actually has sustainable advantages.</p>

    <h3 id="thinking4">4. The Big Unknown: New Categories We Can't See</h3>

    <p>In 2007, no one predicted the App Store would create a $200B+ economy. It's almost certain that AI will enable entirely new categories of value creation we can't predict. That said, I would be surprised if at-scale adoption happens sooner than 2028 given historical adoption curves (2028 implies 4 years from when the capex scaling began).</p>

    <p>I wonder if this will be a new player or the two new AI platforms (OpenAI and Anthropic). The answer likely depends on whether foundation models become commoditized. Will antitrust regulations allow the MAG7 to acquire these companies?</p>

    <h2>In Close</h2>

    <p>The bull case rests on the hyperscalers executing perfectly and adoption to accelerate with visible traction in 2026, with the MAG7 able to take a share of this upside. I find that the probability of all this happening low. But hey - I might be wrong!</p>
    
    <p>Overall - we live in fascinating times. I like how Philippe Laffont framed it at EMW earlier this year: it's such an interesting set of questions - why is Amazon investing less than their peers in capex? Will that impact AWS's competitiveness versus Azure and Google Cloud? What is Apple's bet likely to be? What happens to online search? How will the digital ads ecosystem change?</p>

    <p>I plan to update this article as more perspectives emerge. Overall - I'm convinced the current state cannot continue for longer - something significant will have to change in 2026.</p>
