    <h1>The 100th Take on Gen AI You Didn't Ask For</h1>

    <p>There's a memorable <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SoAk7zBTrvo"> scene</a> in The Matrix where Trinity learns how to fly a helicopter by downloading a module to her brain in seconds. I thought about this recently when I rapidly built software I had no business knowing how to create.</p>

    <p>Like most knowledge workers in 2024, I use LLMs often, mostly to write first drafts, summarize content and for more efficient online searches. But recently, I started using Claude to help me code, and it's been a revelation. So far, I have built several things I wouldn't have attempted before: a case summarizer for a friend that saved her weeks of manual work, a podcast editing tool that removes host segments and replaces them with summaries in my voice, and a children's app that generates customized stories in the style of Beatrix Potter. These tools called on multiple APIs for various models (ChatGPT, ElevenLabs, HuggingFace). Each of these would have taken me months to figure out independently - and I never cared enough to spend hours learning syntax and debugging code*.</p>

    <p class="footnote">* I still spend a fair amount of time refining the algorithm and debugging, but I think that will be solved soon.</p>

    <p>This experience made me reconsider how we think about skilling today. We're at one of those rare inflection points and this is my take on it.</p>

    <p>Any "skill" that is deterministic will soon become redundant. If you can describe a task to someone and expect a predictable outcome, assume that an LLM will take over it. This isn't limited to coding – it applies to design, data analysis, copywriting and more. The implication is that being "technical" in the traditional sense will matter less and less, becoming as quaint as memorizing phone numbers.</p>

    <p>I think what remains uniquely human distills to three qualities:</p>
    <p>1. <strong>Judgment</strong>: What are important, meaningful questions to explore?<br>
    2. <strong>Intuition</strong>: What are efficient ways to approach and solve problems?<br>
    3. <strong>Taste</strong>: What does "good" look like and what is your unique style?</p>

    <p>Our education systems barely prioritize these abilities. Those who possess these skills have usually abstracted general principles while learning traditional subjects like Math and History - almost by accident, like a fortunate side effect.</p>

    <p>What does this mean for us today? It's time to upskill, but not in the way we usually think about it. Instead of learning specific technical skills, we need to find ways to improve these abilities. Some ways I have been trying to do this:</p>

    <p>1. <strong>Judgment</strong>: Exploring different idea spaces and understand their big questions. Build a baseline understanding to understand what their canons have and what they miss. I've found that reading and listening to podcasts gets me a decent distance.</p>

    <p>2. <strong>Intuition</strong>: Improving how I think about systems, learning the basics of different mental models and analytical techniques. <a href="https://www.readthesequences.com/Book-II-How-To-Actually-Change-Your-Mind">This</a> is a helpful recent discovery</p>

    <p>3. <strong>Taste</strong>: Creating more and developing taste by looking at more creations. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRIZ"> TRIZ framing of creativity</a> (which I heavily endorse) gets at the same idea.</p>

    <p>Education has already changed in our lifetimes. From memorizing verses to learning long-form division to writing code – each generation had to adapt to new tools. We're living through a similar transition, but at a much faster pace.</p>

    <p>What will soon matter most is not the ability to code the best or design the prettiest interfaces. What <italics> will </italics>matter is having a nose for asking the right questions, thinking clearly and problem solving, and knowing what "good" looks like. The tools will handle the rest.</p>
